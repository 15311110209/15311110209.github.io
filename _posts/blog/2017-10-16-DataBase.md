# **1. 大数据时代已经来临** #

在电商带动经济发展的同时，大量的数据也开始悄然生息的成指数级的生长，这标志着大数据的时代已经到来，而我们的需求也正在被这些不断增长的数据所标注着。一同挤上这趟快车的还有各大数据库公司，而作为it的我们学了数据库，代码中使用数据库，那我们真的知道我们真真需要的数据库到底是真的符合我们的现实需求吗？还是是我们是管中窥豹，井底之蛙？至少目前的我，真的不知道在如今无数的数据库中，如何去作出选择，我们的指向又该何去何从？

# **2.数据？库？** #
Wikipedia对于[Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data)的解释是（顺带附上[百度百科](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE/5947370)的）

> Data, information, knowledge and wisdom are closely related concepts, but each has its own role in relation to the other, and each term has its own meaning. Data is collected and analyzed; data only becomes information suitable for making decisions once it has been analyzed in some fashion.Knowledge is derived from extensive amounts of experience dealing with information on a subject. For example, the height of Mount Everest is generally considered data. The height can be recorded precisely with an altimeter and entered into a database. This data may be included in a book along with other data on Mount Everest to describe the mountain in a manner useful for those who wish to make a decision about the best method to climb it. Using an understanding based on experience climbing mountains to advise persons on the way to reach Mount Everest's peak may be seen as "knowledge". Some complement the series "data", "information" and "knowledge" with "wisdom", which would mean the status of a person in possession of a certain "knowledge" who also knows under which circumstances is good to use it.


> Data is the least abstract concept, information the next least, and knowledge the most abstract.Data becomes information by interpretation; e.g., the height of Mount Everest is generally considered "data", a book on Mount Everest geological characteristics may be considered "information", and a climber's guidebook containing practical information on the best way to reach Mount Everest's peak may be considered "knowledge". "Information" bears a diversity of meanings that ranges from everyday usage to technical use. Generally speaking, the concept of information is closely related to notions of constraint, communication, control, data, form, instruction, knowledge, meaning, mental stimulus, pattern, perception, and representation. Beynon-Davies uses the concept of a sign to differentiate between data and information; data is a series of symbols, while information occurs when the symbols are used to refer to something.


> Before the development of computing devices and machines, only people could collect data and impose patterns on it. Since the development of computing devices and machines, these devices can also collect data. In the 2010s, computers are widely used in many fields to collect data and sort or process it, in disciplines ranging from marketing, analysis of social services usage by citizens to scientific research. These patterns in data are seen as information which can be used to enhance knowledge. These patterns may be interpreted as "truth" (though "truth" can be a subjective concept), and may be authorized as aesthetic and ethical criteria in some disciplines or cultures. Events that leave behind perceivable physical or virtual remains can be traced back through data. Marks are no longer considered data once the link between the mark and observation is broken.


> Mechanical computing devices are classified according to the means by which they represent data. An analog computer represents a datum as a voltage, distance, position, or other physical quantity. A digital computer represents a piece of data as a sequence of symbols drawn from a fixed alphabet. The most common digital computers use a binary alphabet, that is, an alphabet of two characters, typically denoted "0" and "1". More familiar representations, such as numbers or letters, are then constructed from the binary alphabet. Some special forms of data are distinguished. A computer program is a collection of data, which can be interpreted as instructions. Most computer languages make a distinction between programs and the other data on which programs operate, but in some languages, notably Lisp and similar languages, programs are essentially indistinguishable from other data. It is also useful to distinguish metadata, that is, a description of other data. A similar yet earlier term for metadata is "ancillary data." The prototypical example of metadata is the library catalog, which is a description of the contents of books.

而在Wikipedia对Database的解释中，顺带就提上了各种DBMS
> A database-management system (DBMS) is a computer-software application that interacts with end-users, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS allows the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases. Well-known DBMSs include **MySQL**, PostgreSQL, EnterpriseDB, **MongoDB**, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, **Oracle**, Sybase, SAP HANA, MemSQL, SQLite and IBM DB2.

这么多的英文句子说不定就已经把我们中有些人给搞晕了，更别说一下就来这么多的管理工具，数据库都还没整清楚，这管理工具又该怎么弄呢？

这个时候，就应该来一个本书为我们解答了

> [数据库通常分为**层次式数据库**、**网络式数据库**和**关系式数据库**三种](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%BA%93#5)。而不同的数据库是按不同的数据结构来联系和组织的。

当然这个时候你如果转回来继续看了，那我建议你还是继续把刚刚“那本书”给看下去。然后再继续往下
